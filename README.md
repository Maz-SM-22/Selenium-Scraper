# Selenium-Scraper
2 examples of web crawlers/scapers using selenium

The idea of this code example is to show two possible implementations for webscraping with selenium: ecommerce and streaming.  

One scraper combines requests to scrape an ecommerce shopping results page and selenium to scrape the individual pages which are extracted by the results page scraper. 

The other scraper uses selenium to search for a specified search term and then to navigate through the results pages by clicking, scraping the results as it goes. Then, also uses selenium to scrape each individual results page, interacting with the pag to click and extract the download links. 

I have included both the jupyter notebook and .py files in this repo.
